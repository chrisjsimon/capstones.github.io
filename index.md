<p>Our cohorot's first capstone was an exciting and interesting project since prior to this I was unaware that Excel could do so much more than the usual spreadsheet functionalities that I was used to doing. In the module, I learned that Excel is capable of Data Preparation and Dashboards to visualised stories for presentations. I have heard a lot about Big Data and until this programme my knowledge of the term was minimal. I think that Excel Dashboard was a good introduction to Big Data and how to handle them, which is also an important precursor for our subsequent modules. </p>
